### Example workflows and pipelines:

Workflow: BLAST clustering of contigs and extant genomes
Use Case: Discovering frequency, geographic location, and organismal co-occurence of known viruses in environmental samples

Workflow: BLAST clustering of contigs that do not map to extant genomes
Use Case: Discovering groups of unknown viruses!

Workflow: MagicBLAST mapping of reads to extant clusters
Use case: Associating putative knowns with an expanded database

Workflow: Manual characterization of novel virus clusters/sequences!
Use case: Characterizing novel viruses!

Workflow: Characterization of gene families across known and unknown viruses
Use case: Expanding virus gene families, and gaining further insight into their function!
